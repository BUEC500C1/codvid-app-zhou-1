Use CODVID-19 [API](https://covid19api.com/) ([Documentation using postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest)) to build mobile application that displays:     
1. CODVID cases per country on a MAP   
2. CODVID cases per country Live on a MAP (changes)   
3. CODVID cases per country based on a date.   
4. Summary of total cases for the world   
5. Live Summary for the World    

Stretch goal:
1. Display data per Province
2. User can put their address and track CODVID-19 in their neighborhood (Only in countries where regional data is provided)

Steps:   
Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment      
Step 2:  Go through REACT native Tutorial     
Build Hello Applications    
Run Hello applications on emulator and your phone.    
It will be great to run it on two phones if you can (iOS and Android)     
Step 3:  Develop use case to display a map.  (GitHub location)    
Step 4:  On separate branch, exercise the CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) and display the data in your application as text.  Be fancy!  Style your results.      
Step 5:  Overlay the data on the maps.      

## Process    
#### Step 1:  Setup your REACT Native Environment [Done]        
Download Expo CLI     
Use npm to install the Expo CLI:    
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
But since I had to borrow laptop, I can only try web version - Snack.      

#### Step 2: Build and run Hello App on emulator and phone
